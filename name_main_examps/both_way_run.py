#You write some other function function to say and then down here at the bottom what you #end up doing

#is you just call your function so you'll say OK execute function to then execute #function 1 and then

#maybe have a little bit of logic here but the main idea is that this is more for code organization.

#You have all your functions and classes defined up here and then your logic where you actually execute

#things are defined.

#Here at the bottom and this is a really common structure you will see for larger that by scripts especially

#when you begin to use modules and packages.
